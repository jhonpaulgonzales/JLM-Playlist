    When a day is said and done<br>
    In the middle of the night, and you're fast asleep, my love<br>
    Stay awake looking at your beauty<br>
    Telling myself I'm the luckiest man alive<br>

    'Cause so many times I was certain<br>
    You was gonna walk out of my life, life<br>
    Why you take such a hold of me, girl<br>
    When I'm still trying to get my act right?<br><br>

    What is the reason when you really could have any man you want?<br>
    I don't see what I have to offer<br>
    I should've been a season<br>
    Guess you could see I had potential<br>
    Do you know you're my miracle? (Oh yeah)<br><br>

    I'm like a statue<br>
    Stuck staring right at you<br>
    Got me frozen in my tracks<br>
    So amazed how you take me back<br>
    Each and every time our love collapsed<br><br>

    Statue<br>
    Stuck staring right at you<br>
    So when I'm lost for words<br>
    Every time I disappoint you<br>
    It's just 'cause I can't believe<br>
    That you're so beautiful<br>
    (Stuck like a statue)<br>
    Don't wanna lose you, no<br>
    (Stuck like a statue)<br><br>

    Ask myself why are you even with me<br>
    After all the shit I put you through?<br>
    Why did you make it hard so with me?<br>
    It's like you're living in an igloo<br>
    But baby your love is so warm it makes my shield melt down, down<br>
    And every time we're both at war you make me come around<br><br>

    What is the reason when you really could have any man you want?<br>
    I don't see what I have to offer<br>
    I should've been a season<br>
    Guess you could see I had potential<br>
    Do you know you're my miracle?<br><br>

    I'm like a statue<br>
    Stuck staring right at you<br>
    Got me frozen in my tracks<br>
    So amazed how you take me back<br>
    Each and every time our love collapsed<br><br>

    Statue<br>
    Stuck staring right at you<br>
    So when I'm lost for words<br>
    Every time I disappoint you<br>
    It's just 'cause I can't believe<br>
    That you're so beautiful<br>
    (Stuck like a statue)<br>
    Don't wanna lose you, no<br>
    (Stuck like a statue)<br><br>
    
    And you're so beautiful<br>
    (Stuck like a statue)<br>
    Don't wanna lose you never<br>
    (Stuck like a statue)<br>
    Oh, no<br><br>
    
    Every single day of my life, I thank my lucky stars<br>
    God really had to spend extra time when he sculpted your heart<br>
    'Cause there's no explanation<br>
    Can't solve the equation<br>
    It's like you love me more than I love myself<br><br>
    
    I'm like a statue<br>
    Stuck staring right at you<br>
    Got me frozen in my tracks<br>
    So amazed how you take me back<br>
    Each and every time our love collapsed<br><br>
    
    Statue<br>
    Stuck staring right at you<br>
    So when I'm lost for words (Statue)<br>
    Every time I disappoint you<br>
    Baby, it's 'cause I can't believe ('Cause you're my statue)<br><br>
    
    That you're so beautiful (Girl, you are the reason)<br>
    Stuck like a statue (The reason for living)<br>
    Don't wanna lose you, no (The reason for breathing)<br>
    Stuck like a statue (You're so beautiful)<br><br>
   
    And you're so beautiful (And I want you to feel it)<br>
    Stuck like a statue ('Cause so bad I mean it)<br>
    Don't wanna lose you, no (You're the reason for breathing)<br>
    Stuck like a statue (You're so beautiful)<br>
    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah yeah<br><br>
    
    When the day is said and done<br>
    In the middle of the night, and you're fast asleep, my love<br>
    I'm the luckiest man alive</p></center>
